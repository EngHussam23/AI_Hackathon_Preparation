EXPECTATIONS

What it should deliver:

# Core Tasks (Must-Have):
© Document Classification:
Accurately classify documents into 5 document types (e.g., invoice, receipt,
resume, report, contract).
The system should automatically identify the document type based on
layout, text content, and visual cues.
© OCR Extraction: Perform OCR primarily in English including handwriting. This
task is a major challenge and already a highly valuable solution on its own.
© Structured Data Extraction: For one or two document types (e.g., invoices and
receipts), extract key information into a structured format like JSON. This is
more valuable than a generic text summary.

- Example for an invoice:
{ "vendor": "Company A", “invoice_date": "2025-08-19", “total_amount": 1500.75,
“currency”: "THB" }
