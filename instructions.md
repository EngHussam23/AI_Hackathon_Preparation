5. **Mobile-first**: Design for mobile, then scale up to desktop

### Presentation Tips:

1. **Story over features**: Tell a compelling story, not just list features
2. **Demo is king**: A smooth 2-minute demo beats 10 slides of explanation
3. **Practice timing**: Rehearse to stay within time limit (usually 5-7 minutes)
4. **Backup plans**: Have screenshots/video if live demo fails
5. **Show business impact**: Judges care about real-world value

### Team Collaboration:

1. **Define API contract early**: Frontend and backend need to agree on data format
2. **Use branches**: Don't commit directly to main during hackathon
3. **Document as you go**: Future you (in 6 hours) won't remember why you did something
4. **Help teammates**: Winning as a team beats individual heroics
5. **Stay positive**: Things will break - it's normal, stay calm and fix them

### Technical Debugging:

1. **Browser DevTools**: Learn to read Network tab and Console errors
2. **Start with simple**: Upload one file before trying batch uploads
3. **Logs everywhere**: console.log() is your friend during development
4. **Test with real data**: Use actual invoices/receipts, not just test files
5. **Cross-browser check**: Test in Chrome AND Firefox minimum

### Energy Management:

1. **Take breaks**: 48 hours doesn't mean 0 sleep
2. **Eat properly**: Hungry developers write buggy code
3. **Stay hydrated**: Keep water nearby
4. **Split shifts**: If 24/7 coding, rotate who's working when
5. **Sleep before presentation**: Be fresh for the demo
